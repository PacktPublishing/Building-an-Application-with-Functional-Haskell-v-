# Building an Application with Functional Haskell [Video]
This is the code repository for [Building an Application with Functional Haskell [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-application-functional-haskell-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787285088), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Haskell is a powerful and well-designed functional programming language designed to work with complex data. Its emphasis on "purity" makes it easier to create rock-solid applications which stay maintainable and error-free even as they grow in scale.
This video is specifically aimed at anybody who knows the essentials of the Haskell programming language and who is interested in moving onto developing real programs that will make use of file I/O, command-line parsers and various third-party packages.We will start by describing the kind of application that the developer will write. We will then see how we will cover the kind of user interface to expect and the types of data processing and handling that the program will do. We will be seeing the different ways to store data in our filesystem and interact with it. 

By the end of the course, we will have developed a fully-featured command-line utility program that can later be expanded by the developer in many ways
